        <!-- <p>The past several decades have witnessed a dramatic increase in the scale and complexity of scientific and translational research. As the complexity of today’s most pressing health issues and diseases is revealed, collaborations among scientists trained in different fields, from bioinformatics to molecular genetics to biomedical policy, have become essential for exploring and advancing biomedical research discoveries. Given their dual training in medicine and scientific research, physician-scientists are poised to lead team science and the multidisciplinary research initiatives. Our session aims to answer: What constitutes successful team science? What are examples physician-scientists have used in their research endeavors to promote team science productivity? Why do some research teams succeed while others do not? What factors maximize a research team’s productivity or effectiveness? What detracts from team science success?</p> -->

            <h4>Janelle Taylor, PhD, Department of Anthropology Professor at the University of Washington</h4>
            <p>As a sociocultural anthropologist Dr. Janelle Taylor uses ethnographic methods to study health, illness, medical education, medical technology, and medical practice. Her research has focused on a variety of topics relating to medical technology, medical education, and medical practice, including fetal ultrasound imaging, medical decision- making at the end of life, how &#39;culture&#39; is understood and taught within medical education, the work of &quot;Standardized Patients&quot; and ther role in teaching and assessing clinical skills, and questions of recognition and care in relation to dementia. Recent research explores why friendships so often prove fragile after the onset of dementia, and how some friendships nonetheless manage to adapt and adjust. A new grant from the NIA will support research into whether and how differences in health outcomes and/or health care utilization among older adults with dementia may relate to availability of family to provide informal caregiving support. A thread running through all of Dr. Taylor&#39;s research is a concern to document and understand how representations inform social practices; how mediation happens between different systems of value; how &quot;persons&quot; are socially made (and unmade); and how medicine and health care are involved in all of this.</p>

            <h4>David Ostrow, MD, PhD, DavidOstrowConsulting, David Ostrow &amp; Associates, LLC</h4>
            <p>During his training in the MD/PhD Program at the University of Chicago, Dr. David Ostrow co-founded the first gay community health center, now the Howard Brown Health Center of Chicago. There he identified Hepatitis B as a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) among gay men, which led to his Chicago PI role in the CDC-funded Hep B Epidemiology and Vaccine Efficacy Studies (1976-81). As the founding PI of the subsequent Chicago MACS (1983-1985), then co-PI of the Coping &amp; Change Study of Men in the Chicago MACS (1985-1999), and later founder of the Behavioral Working Group (BWG) of the MACS (1991-2011), he focussed on the relationship between sexual behavior, drug use and the evolution of HIV transmission and prevention among drug using MSM. He has published 175 peer-reviewed papers, 50+ book chapters and presented 60+ times at International AIDS Conferences. He is an Investigator or consultant on most of the NIDA funded studies of drugs, alcohol and HIV in the MACS, including his own study of the Social and Risk Networks Assessment of younger Black MSM (2009-2011). This study led to a recently funded study of the dynamic roles of social and risk networks as drivers of the increasing epidemic of new HIV infections among younger Black MSM in Chicago. As the senior behavioral investigator in the MACS, he plans to use the upcoming open recruitment of men at highest risk of or recently infected with HIV to extend these studies to the geographically and racially diverse cohort of HIV+ and HIV- men.</p>
            <p>Since the late ‘90s, Dr. Ostrow has been active in the movement to change failed national drug policies, such as cannabis prohibition, with more effective and compassionate policies, including regulation and legalization of cannabis use, integration of Cannabinoid Medicine training into the Medical Student curriculum, and the formation of a Community-Based Clinical Cannabis Research Network that can inform scientifically based MC treatment guidelines.</p>

This was the first space salvage mission, as the crew retrieved the Palapa B-2 and Westar VI satellites to return to Earth. Fisher also supported shuttle missions STS-1 through STS-7 and served as Capsule Communicator (CAPCOM) for STS-9. She worked as the deputy of the Mission Development branch of the Astronaut Office and served on the Astronaut Selection Board for the 1987 class of astronauts.</p>
            <p>From 1996 to 2002, Fisher was the chief of the Space Station branch of the Astronaut Office, during the early days of the International Space Station (ISS).

        <!-- <p>Mirroring the shift from medical to graduate school, the return to and finishing of medical school prompts medical scientist trainees to address one glaring challenge: starting the next chapter of our professional lives. The purpose of this panel is to enlighten audience members on how to smoothly navigate the often-stressful and seemingly complicated process of transitioning from the later phase of the physician-scientist curriculum towards your own, personal career trajectory. Consisting of a 4th year medical student, PSTP residency director, and resident/fellow on the panel, the intention is to open the entire room up for discussion. Though the focus is on transitions, all topics are highly encouraged for debate, ranging from questions about the traditional academic sequence (e.g., residency, interviewing, match, fellowship, etc.) to the more provocative consideration of non-academic career paths.</p> -->

            <p>Dani Dumitriu, MD, PhD, is an Assistant Professor of Neuroscience and member of the Mindich Child Health and Development Institute and the Institute for Exposomic Research at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. She holds these faculty appointments concurrent with clinical training, currently completing the fifth and final year of a combined General Pediatrics Residency and a fellowship in Pediatric Environmental Health. This unconventional route of combining residency training with starting a lab was born out of a deep fascination with the neurobiology of stress resilience, the focus of the Dumitriu lab. Having begun this work during a brief post-doctoral fellowship toward the end the MD/PhD program at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, upon graduation, Dr. Dumitriu encountered the common physician-scientist predicament: the impossible choice between a prolonged absence from bench work versus continuing a research fellowship and giving up the rewards of clinical medicine. Refusing to make this difficult choice, upon matching into the Pediatric residency at the same institution, Dr. Dumitriu worked with the Departments of Pediatrics, Environmental Health and Neuroscience to develop a custom-tailored five-year track with integrated and increasing research effort. In Year 2, she was awarded a NARSAD Young Investigator award. In Year 3, she was appointed Assistant Professor in a Neuroscience, a non-clinical department. In Year 4, she was awarded an R01 from NIMH, making her the second documented resident (and first female resident) in the U.S. to receive the award during clinical training.</p>
