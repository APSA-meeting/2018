            <h4>Virginia &amp; D.K. Ludwig Professor for Clinical Investigation in Cancer Research at Stanfor University</h4>
            <p>Irving L. Weissman, M.D., is the Director of the Stanford Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine and Director of the Stanford Ludwig Center for Cancer Stem Cell Research. Previously, he was a member of the founding Scientific Advisory Boards of Amgen (1981-1989), DNAX (1981-1992), and T-Cell Sciences (1988-1992). He co-founded, was a Director, and chaired the Scientific Advisory Board at SyStemix 1988-1996, StemCells in 1996-present, and Cellerant  in 2001-9. He founded Forty Seven Inc. in 2015, and is a Director of the Company.</p>
            <p>His research encompasses the biology and evolution of stem cells and progenitor cells, mainly blood-forming and brain-forming. He is also engaged in isolating and characterizing the rare cancer and leukemia stem cells as the only dangerous cells in these malignancies, especially with human cancers. He discovered that all cancer stem cells express CD47, the ‘don’t eat me’ signal, to overcome prophagocytic signals that arise during cancer development, and has shown that blocking antibodies to CD47 have therapeutic potential for all tested human cancers. His laboratory was first to identify and isolate the blood-forming stem cell from mice, and has purified each progenitor in the stages of development between the stem cells and mature progeny (granulocytes, macro-phages, etc.). At SyStemix he co-discovered the human hematopoetic stem cell and at StemCells, he co-discovered a human central nervous system stem cell.</p>

            <h4>President of The Rockefeller University</h4>
            <p>Richard Lifton is President of The Rockefeller University where he is also head of the laboratory of Human Genetics and Genomics. He received MD and PhD degrees from Stanford. He then was Resident and Chief Resident in Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and continued on the Harvard Medical School faculty before being recruited to Yale in 1993, where he served as Sterling Professor and Chair of Genetics from 1998 to 2016 before moving to Rockefeller. At Yale he was also Founder and Executive Director of the Yale Center for Genome Analysis.</p>
            <p>Dr. Lifton has used human genetics and genomics to identify mutations that identify key genes and pathways underlying hypertension, myocardial infarction, osteoporosis, cerebral hemorrhage, congenital heart disease and neoplasia. His work on hypertension, which affects one billion people worldwide, has demonstrated the key roles of renal salt and potassium handling in blood pressure regulation, leading to new approaches to treatment and prevention that have been applied to the general population world-wide. In 2009 his group developed exome sequencing and performed the first clinical diagnosis by genome- level sequencing.</p>

            <h4>Hebrew SeniorLife/Harvard Medical School</h4>
            <p>Dr. Inouye is an internationally recognized leader in geriatric medicine and aging research. She is an elected member of the National Academy of Medicine, chaired the Delirium Clinical Guidelines Panel for the American Geriatrics Society, and serves as an Associate Editor of the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society. Her research focuses on prevention of delirium and cognitive decline with aging, promoting healthy aging and independence follow acute illness, and improvement of healthcare systems through policy.</p>
            <p>Continuously NIH-funded since 1989 with over 50 grants and over 250 publications, Dr. Inouye developed the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM)—the most widely used method for delirium identification, used in over 4000 publications and translated into 20 languages—along with the Hospital Elder Life Program (HELP) for delirium prevention, a cost-effective model of patient-centered care that has been disseminated to over 200 hospitals worldwide. She was recently awarded an R24 Delirium Network grant by the National Institutes of Health. She is committed to translating research into practice and policy changes.</p>
